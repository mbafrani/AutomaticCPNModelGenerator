* Points: 9/10

The document organized and styled well and captured most of the essential aspects of the project, adding and considering few points will later help in ending up with good and high-quality projects: 
1. Very well referenced and use of the literature, however, could have been more elaborated on the general techniques that can be used, performance analyses, discovery model, and... 
2. Good elaboration on risk factors. 
3. The details of the project in the Gantt chart could be more specific since you already have the information, e.g., you start with process discover, writing to the CPN file, getting to know the structure of CPN models and tools, developing the module for interaction with the CPN model and â€¦.. 
4. For the discovery technique, Alpha miner is not a good choice you could look for more modern and usable techniques in the pm4py for instance. However, it's not affecting the grade of this assignment just to give you some idea that you should broaden your view and research. 
5. The main focus of the work for you is to get the back-end correct that would have been nice to see the focus on that. If the back-end works fine: an event log goes in and a CPN model (a file) comes out for the baseline and the user interaction and UI will be fast and easy. 
6. Work distribution looks good and hopefully stay the same until the end of the project.
