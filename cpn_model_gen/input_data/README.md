## ETM Configurations
* Loan application example
* Actually 4 Configurations.
* A collection of artificial event logs describing 4 variants of a simple loan application process. Variant 1 is the most complex process with parallelism and choices. The other 3 variants have a simpler, more sequential, control flow and some activities of variant 1 are missing or split into 2. These event logs are used to test different approaches of discovering a configurable process model from a collection of event logs.
