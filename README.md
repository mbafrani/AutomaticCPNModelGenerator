## User Manual 
- Upload an event log in the form of XES or CSV. 
  - Note that the attributes name should follow the XES Standard.
- Check the extracted model.
- Change the parameters for running different scenarios.
- Download the CPN model and the SML file as a zip file.
- Extract both files in one location.
